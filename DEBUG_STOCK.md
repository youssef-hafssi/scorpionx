# Stock Management Debug Information

The stock management page is showing the error "Error saving changes. Please try again." 

## Current Issue
The GET request works fine and returns stock data, but the PUT request fails with a 500 Internal Server Error.

## Possible Causes

1. **Database Schema Mismatch**: The `product_stock` table might have a different structure than expected
2. **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Supabase RLS policies might be blocking updates
3. **Primary Key Type Mismatch**: The API expects string IDs but gets UUIDs
4. **Missing Columns**: The update might be trying to set columns that don't exist

## Debugging Steps Taken

✅ Verified API GET endpoint works - returns stock data
❌ PUT endpoint fails with 500 error
✅ Confirmed Supabase connection is working
❌ Update operation fails

## Solution Needed

We need to:
1. Check the exact database table structure
2. Verify the RLS policies
3. Debug the specific error from the API logs
4. Fix the update query to match the actual database schema
